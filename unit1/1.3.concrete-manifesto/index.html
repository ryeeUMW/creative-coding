        Superflux: Manifesto (2021)
        We are more than human. We know where we are.

        My idea for this design was that as humans we are easily influcenced by others. I personally also feel as though I am also always trying to find my own place in the world. My design reflects that we sometimes "fall off" as indicated by the first line of text, and influcenced/shaped by others, as indicated by the third line of text.
